1. Name of the program: CNNFaultRecog
2. Title of the manuscript:Supervised fully convolutional neural network for fault recognition in 3D seismic images trained using a small dataset
3. Author details: china university of petroleum (East china), ntibajoseph@gmail.com 
4. Instruction guide:
to use this codes you will need to:
	a. install anaconda navigator, windows installer that is availlable on https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
	b. install the following addional packages: tensorflow, os, sys, random, numpy, numpy.ma, opencv,matplotlib.pyplot, tqdm, skimage, sklearn and keras.
after the installation of all packages, launch Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter Notebook from it. from the open jupyter window, path to the CNNFaultRecogTest.ipynb file and run it if you want to predict fault on testing data.
If you want to train the model using your own data, please use the CNNFaultRecogTrain.ipynb file.

Note: the above addional packages can be innstalled via Anaconda Prompt Comand.
