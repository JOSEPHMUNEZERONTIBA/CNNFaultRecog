1. Nome of the program: CNNFaultRecog
2. Title of the manuscript:Supervised fully convolutional neural network for fault recognition in 3D seismic images trained using a small dataset
3. Author details: china university of petroleum (East china), ntibajoseph@gmail.com 
4. Instruction guide:
to use this codes yuou need
	install anaconda navigator, windows installer that is availlable on https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
	install the following addional packages: tensorflow, os, sys, random, numpy, numpy.ma, opencv,
 					matplotlib.pyplot, tqdm, skimage, sklearn and keras.
	after installation of all packages, launch Anaconda Navigator and Jupyter Notebook from it.
	from the open jupyter window, path to the CNNFaultRecogTest.ipynb file and run it if you want to predict fault on testing data

Note: the above addional packages can be innstalled via Anaconda Prompt Comand. If you want to test the code training it on your own data set, use the CNNFaultRecogTrain.ipynb file.
